# smartscale
NodeMCU v3 and HX711 powered Smart-Scale modification

# Assembly
I have been inspired by projects from hackster.io and squix, getting all the parts together.

# Parts
NodeMCU v3;
HX711;
LCD Screen (some screen from aliexpress for 2$ will do);
A random scale from your electronics store (I bought one from the german "Saturn" market for 10â‚¬);
Several wires
A breadboard for testing (optional)

# Software
Just change the hardware-specific parts matching to the stuff you ordered and upload it via arduino IDE to your ESP8266
